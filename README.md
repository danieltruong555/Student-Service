# Student-Service
A simple Web API that allows authenticated users to retrieve Student information from an SQL server.  
Note: Used AJAX and jQuery to make requests to the web API and also update the HTML page with the results. To request data from the server, use Login.html to login with your credentials which will redirect you to Data.html.
